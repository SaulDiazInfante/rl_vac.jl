## Description
Given initial program with time deliveries and Inventory sizes
```math
(t_k, K_{stock}),
```
the function perturbs this quantities with Gaussian variables
```math
\\tau_k \\sim
\\mathrm{TruncatedNormal}
\\left(
    \\mu_{\\tau_k},\\sigma_{\tau_k},\\mathrm{support}_{\\tau_k}
\\right)
``` 

Start by having a look at the [tutorial](@ref tutorial), after which you can
consult individual library functions in [API](@ref). Many more examples can be found
in the dedicated examples page.
